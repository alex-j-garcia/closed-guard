      </div>
      <p>Traditionally considered the fundamental guard in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the closed guard is commonly referred to as a 50/50 position. Players of equal skill are considered to be in a neutral position, with no advantage going to either player.</p>

      <p>Skilled closed guard players --notably <a href="https://youtu.be/N3B2ro-Ty1c?t=73" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Roger Gracie</a>-- proved that this position is extremely advantageous to the bottom player and used it competitively to submit opponents on the world stage.</p>

             alt="Top player attempting to escape opponent's closed guard">
      </div>
      <p>The burden of opening the guard belongs to the top position player and can be extremely hard to do against a closed guard specialist. The opponent's closed guard should be avoided if at all possible.</p>
