      <p>Traditionally considered the fundamental guard in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the closed guard is commonly referred to as a 50/50 position. Players of equal skill are considered to be in a neutral position, with no advantage going to either player.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Skilled closed guard players --notably Roger Gracie-- proved that this position is extremely advantageous to the bottom player and used it competitively to submit opponents on the world stage.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The burden of opening the guard belongs to the top position player and can be extremely hard to do against a closed guard specialist. The opponent's closed guard should be avoided if at all possible.</p>
